## Kamotchi
- the name is a spin on tamagotchi (a cross between egg and friend in japanese); replacing tamago (egg) with kamo (duck)!
- raise your pet from an egg to a full-grown duck
- keep your duck's food, happiness and sleep stats above zero to avoid a game over
- play minigames to raise your duck's stats and help it grow!

I made this project for Hack Club's Athena award and the Girls who Code Summer Immersion Programme!

I made this project using p5.js and piskel! It was my first project using javascript, so there was a pretty big learning curve in terms of syntax and the language's quirks.
This project taught me the basics of p5, helped me improve my pixel art and get faster at it. I also improved my ability to brainstorm and plan effectively and learnt to playtest and iterate on my work during the development process.
